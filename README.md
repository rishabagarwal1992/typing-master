# Typing Master
Initial commit for a simple typing test where users can take a test for either 60/180 seconds as of now.
Each correct word will give you 10 points and each incorrect word deducts 5 points
Your score will be displayed once the timer elapsed and will show the speed and final score.
A word will be counted only once you press a space.

Future options:
1. Provide different themes for the user to select
2. Provide more timer options
3. Restrict user from pressing backspace key
4. Find a more optimized way to calculate words as of now we are will consider a word is trped on pressing space character
